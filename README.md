# 🐻 Gruzzly's Addon Armory

**Welcome to the repository of things I built because I was bored, annoyed, or heavily caffeinated.** This repo serves as the central hub for my World of Warcraft addons. Some are useful, some are flavor, and some are just here to make the voices in your head a little louder.

## 📦 The Collection

| Addon | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accent Chat** | Automatically converts your chat messages into various accents. Makes you sound like you have a personality, even if you don't. | 🟢 Active |
| **MyBIS** | A simple tracker for your Best-in-Slot gear. Designed to help you be disappointed more efficiently when your loot doesn't drop. | 🟢 Active |
| **Intrusive Thoughts** | Random text events and weird pop-ups. Don't let the voices win (or do, I'm a tooltip, not a cop). | 🟢 Active |
| **Glamour** | Tools to manage transmogs and outfits. Because if you aren't parsing 99 in fashion, why are you even logging in? | 🟢 Maintenance |
| **Character Quirks** | Adds RPG flavor text and behavioral quirks to your character sheet. Immersion +10. | 🟢 Active |
| **NPCGlass** | Not sure just yet. Custom Chat Addon | 🟡 Incomplete |

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Download** the addon you want from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/gruzzly/projects) (or clone this repo if you enjoy suffering).
2.  **Unzip** the folder. (If from the repo)
3.  **Drag and Drop** the folder into your WoW directory:
    `_retail_ / Interface / Addons`
4.  **Restart WoW**. If it explodes, you did it wrong (or I did, but let's assume it was you).
